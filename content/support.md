If something dreadful happens then you should probably call 112. If something untoward is happening to Frozen Synapse then you should check the [support forum](http://forums.mode7games.com/viewforum.php?f=21) first and if your woe is not solved, you should contact support.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Contacting_Support">Contacting Support</span>

Any bug reports should either be posted to the [support forum](http://forums.mode7games.com/viewforum.php?f=21) or emailed to support@mode7games.com. Bug reports should include a brief description of what went wrong, any relevant information (game IDs etc) and you should attach the console logs if you managed to make the game start.

The console logs are located in the Frozen Synapse install directory and called console.log and console2.log. You should quit the game before attaching the logs.
