title: Stance

Stance is whether or not an unit is standing. Changing stance causes as 0.5s delay to the [[principles-of-combat.md|Time to Kill]].

Ducking allows [[unit-types.md|units]] to hide behind [[cover.md|Cover]], breaking [[line-of-sight.md|Line of Sight]]. Being crouched does not affect a [[principles-of-combat.md|Direct fire]] unit's combat modifiers at all, it only determines line of sight.

There is a significant penalty to direct fire units for a short time after ducking (see [[principles-of-combat.md|Principles of Combat]]).

[[unit-types.md|Grenade launchers]] are the only unit that can fire over cover when crouched.

[[unit-types.md|Rocket launchers]] can hit [[cover.md|cover]] when crouched.

Ducking can be useful for distraction and for avoiding damage, but little else. To stop crouching, just give the unit a Stand command.

Commands a [[unit-types.md|unit]] to stand up.

This is only useful on a unit that is currently ducking. The unit will stand up. A standing unit is visible over any intervening low cover.

A unit that stands will receive a heavy penalty to aiming for a short time after standing (see [[principles-of-combat.md|Principles of Combat]]).
