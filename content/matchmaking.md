The automatic matchmaking is a traffic light state that will determine how it looks for games and a list of modes that it will attempt to find games for.



## <span class="mw-headline" id="Game_Modes">Game Modes</span>

A list of all [[game-modes.md|game modes]] that are available. The modes you have selected will be used as the game modes that you want to play when matchmaking. The server will always attempt to find games that are of a mode you have selected but sometimes you will end up with games you have not selected. This has no effect when you are set to red.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Green">Green</span>

Green indicates that you want a game as soon as possible. The server will actively attempt to find a game for you.

When green is selected the server will attempt to find another player who is currently green or yellow. If it can find someone it will match you together and create a game. If it can't find someone it will create a global challenge that everyone online will see appear at the bottom left. Once this is accepted the server will create a match between you and the person who accepted the challenge.

When two green players are matched together the server will compare the modes you have both selected and attempt to find a common mode. If it can then a game in one of those modes will be created. If it can't find any common modes then it will pick a mode from the list of the person who first went green and create a game with that mode. This means that the second person can end up with a mode that they didn't choose. The person who went green first will be player 1 in the game.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Yellow">Yellow</span>

<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"><img src="images/thumb/5/52/Matchmaking_Yellow.png/200px-Matchmaking_Yellow.png" />  <div class="thumbcaption">Yellow traffic light icon.</div></div></div>

Yellow indicates that you would like a game but don't mind waiting. While yellow you will only get the game modes you've enabled.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Red">Red</span>

Red indicates that you do not want a game at the moment. The server will not provide you as a match to any automatic matchmaking. You will still receive global challenges at the bottom left.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Issues"> Issues </span>

Many users have issues (minor to significant) with the matchmaking system.  [Omroth wants to fix them.](http://www.mode7games.com/blog/2011/06/14/new-matchmaking-system/)

User complaints, in his words:

*   I get a game mode I didn’t select! STUPID GAME DEVELOPERS

*   It keeps challenging me while I’m on red!  STUPID GAME DEVELOPERS

We'll see what improvements get added!
