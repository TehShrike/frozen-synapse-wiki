title: Distraction

**Distraction** is a tactic used to give a unit, who would otherwise lose an encounter, a time advantage. The fundamental principle for a Distraction Attack is having one of the distracting player's units, the Decoy, expose itself to be fired at then return to cover while another unit, the Shooter/Runner, uses the small time advantage to either gun down the Victim or move between safe zones, functionally reducing the "dangerous" distance of them by reducing the amount of time the Runner is in danger.



## <span class="mw-headline" id="How_It_Works"> How It Works </span>

The above description summarizes the basic elements of a Distraction Attack, but there are several ways to initiate the distraction.

*   Two units run out into the open, the Shooter following the Decoy. They see and are seen one at a time.

*   Two units run out into the open at the exact same time, but the Decoy is closer to the Victim than the Shooter, drawing its fire. This is difficult to accomplish and usually ends up being the first type mentioned... though sometimes your Shooter and Decoy may change roles with dire results.

*   Two units stand in unison, with the Decoy closer than the Shooter. This is a fairly reliable method on the condition that the brief [[principles-of-combat.md|Aim Delay from Standing]] isn't enough to tip the balance away from you.

*   One unit runs out as a Decoy while the Runner moves to its destination, but the latter part of the Runner's movement into safety acts as a secondary Distraction so that the original Decoy can also move. This requires the Decoy to briefly break Line of Sight.

After initiating a distraction attack, you permit the Decoy to draw fire until the last second, then break line of sight by ducking behind cover or running behind a wall.

For optimal results, a unit behind cover at a long distance will be able to soak the most aim time before being in danger. Barring that, cover is likely to be more important than distance if you aren't using a [[unit-types.md|Sniper]] as a Decoy.

Using a Distraction to let a unit run between areas or to let it scout the enemy and retreat is functionally identical in almost all ways. However, instead of buying a unit enough time that it can shoot a distracted unit, the not-Attacker simply needs to travel or scout in the bought time and then make it to safety as well.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_It_Works"> Why It Works </span>

Distraction utilizes the fact that a unit, unless given special orders to [[ignore-focus.md|Focus or Ignore]] a [[zones.md|Zone]] or Unit, your enemy's units (or yours) will automatically target the first thing they see (or, when confronted with multiple units simultaneously, the closest one). Additionally, with the removal of the unintuitive Global Aim Counters (a system where a unit's aim was preserved between targets, yielding fantastically nonsensical results) this no longer yields the result of your second unit, who is some 20 feet away, being instantly shot in the head. While Distraction can be countered with Focus/Ignore orders, this can lead to intense levels of mind-gaming. In such situations, [[zones.md|Zone Ignore]] can come in handy as a counter.

Distraction is used to screen another unit; it can be useful when saving or just covering a [[hostage.md|Hostage]], to scout the enemy defense or sneak a unit past it in [[secure.md|Secure]] or [[charge.md|Charge]], to secure clean kills in [[extermination.md|Extermination]], and the like. It is most useful against enemy MG's and Snipers, but can be used against enemy SGs for very brief periods, just ensure the SG is being forced to fire at maximum range (multiple shots) to give you the largest timeframe.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Countering"> Countering </span>

To counter a Distraction you have to ignore the enemy's Decoy unit or the zone you expect him to use. In a 2v1 situation this could be a complete gamble as you might not know which unit your opponent will use for each task, however if you have 2 units covering the same area, set each to ignore a different one of the enemies.
