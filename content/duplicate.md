title: Duplicate

A duplicate game is one where the map, [[unit-types.md|unit]] counts, unit positions and objectives are entirely identical to a previous game but the players on each side vary.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Purpose">Purpose</span>

Duplicate games are used for a specific type of scoring called [[rank.md|Duplicate Scoring]], which ranks players based on how well they did on the map as compared to the other players that played the same side. This provides a very accurate assessment of how well they've played compared to the others as all conditions were equal for all players. Players who play on opposite sides of the same game are not compared. Everyone who played team 1 on the map are compared to each other and everyone who played team 2 on the map are compared to each other.

They also provide an effective way to learn new tactics as you can see what others in the same situation have done.

When the server attempts to find a map to play for a match it will first look at all of the maps for the same mode that have been played today. If one can be found that is unplayed by both players in the match then that will be selected and played. If there are none available or they have all been played by at least one of the players then a new map will be generated. This will be available to future games as a duplicate game.

Initially there may be no duplicates available but over time some should appear. The check to see if either has played the map should ensure that you never play a duplicate of your own game.

On the results screen of a finished map there is a button to move to the Next Duplicate, which will load the next duplicate of the current match. A list of all the duplicates can also be viewed by searching for the game using the search facility. A list of all duplicates of a given match is shown at the bottom.
