title: Getting Started

An interactive tutorial and a quick tutorial video are available in the Single Player menu.

We recommend you play these, then have a quick game against the AI (again from the Single Player menu) to kick things off.  After that, you'll be ready to play online for the first time.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="The_Level">The Level</span>

When you start a new game, you'll be confronted with a map.

Dark blue areas are walls; light blue areas are half-height objects or windows.

Half-height areas can be ducked behind and fired over.

Explosions caused by [[unit-types.md|rockets]] can destroy walls, whereas explosions caused by [[unit-types.md|grenades]] cannot.

To move the camera around the map, hold down the right mouse button and move the mouse, or use the arrow keys.

To zoom, use the mouse-wheel or the "M" and "K" keys.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Teams">Teams</span>

The green team are your [[unit-types.md|units]]; the red team are hostiles.

In single player, the teal units are units who cannot be attacked by your forces and generally have a hostile affiliation.
Yellow units are friendly units controlled by the computer - you cannot make plans for them.

Colors can be changed in the Options menu.  If you set custom colors, they will only be seen locally: your opponent in multiplayer will not see any difference.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Turns_and_Plans">Turns and Plans</span>

Matches are comprised of [[turns.md|turns]] that usually last for five seconds.

Both you and your opponent will need to make a [[making-a-plan.md|plan]], then press the PRIME button on the time bar at the bottom of the screen to commit it.  When both plans are committed, you will both be able to see the outcome of your actions.

In single player, the AI will need to calculate its response to your plan.  The time this takes will vary depending on the performance of your computer.
