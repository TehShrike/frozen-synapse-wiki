title: Panarch Collaborative

_The text below is taken from the dossiers on the Panarch Collaborative_

Our predecessors had it wrong.

We have always had the gift of an alternative perspective; we should use that gift to reveal the riches here in Torpor.  Why are we fighting for territory when we have already won?

For decades, we have tried to make [[markov-geist.md|Markov Geist]] listen by bombing, interdiction and subversion.  Why continue to do this when we know the city cannot hear us?  

Look around yourself: you may see desolation.  Let me tell you what I see: potential.  

Every fissure, every crack in the ground is an opportunity.

We must set the target of achieving a self-sustaining environment in Torpor, but not only that: we must construct a new society; one which expresses our passion for life, our desire to right the wrongs of the past.   

We must create the Revenant Coast.

I call it this because I believe that the coast we destroyed with our endless expansions, our endless pursuit of more and more capacity for the shape, will return to haunt its tormentors.  

The sea feeds and sustains us, its tide marks our finite time in the presence of our loved ones.

Humans are not just simple consumers; we are not here to burn up our surroundings and move on.  

Our base instincts keep us in equilibrium with nature; it is our over-elaborated society which has corrupted our intentions.

This huge domed structure in Torpor serves as a symbol for the Panarch ideology.

Assembled from the detritus of many disused and abandoned buildings, it is a vast arcology which houses many key Panarch facilities.

Panarchs inside Cairn live in cross-generational "networks", organising themselves around particular tasks.  Although this often leads to competition and rivalry, overall the society of Cairn functions well.

Cairn continues to grow over time, with other smaller habitats springing up throughout the wastes.

Much of Cairn is dedicated to agricultural development and [[vatform.md|vatform]] production: the Panarchs use its vast climate-controlled areas to provide a fertile environment.
