title: Unit Types

There are 5 unit types in Frozen Synapse's multiplayer. Machine gun, Shotgun, Sniper, Grenade Launcher and Rocket Launcher. Each have differing characteristics when used in the game including ammo type, range, reload time and rate of fire.

Base kill time is how long it takes them to kill an enemy standing right next to them. Turn delay is how much time is added to Time to Kill by turning around.

The assault rifle has a rapid rate of fire. The range on the Assault Rifle is as long as most maps, but [[principles-of-combat.md|Time to Kill]] suffers at longer ranges. It is slightly shorter than the standard charge map. Unless the player ignores an enemy the Machine Gun will automatically fire at any target.

*   Base kill time: 320ms

*   Turn delay: 128ms

*   Range: 75 tiles

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Shotgun">Shotgun</span>

<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:82px;"><img src="images/thumb/b/bc/Unit_SG.jpg/80px-Unit_SG.jpg" />  <div class="thumbcaption">Shotgun</div></div></div>

The shotgun is a close range weapon that fires several pellets at once, just like a real shotgun. The reaction time of a shotgun vs any other weapon at close range is always quicker, and it will therefore win within its own range unless the enemy has a big situational advantage. Unless an enemy is flagged to be ignored or the enemy is out of range, the Shotgun will fire automatically.

*   Base kill time: 320ms

*   Turn delay: 32ms

*   Range: 16 tiles

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Sniper">Sniper</span>

<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:82px;"><img src="images/thumb/3/3b/Unit_SN.jpg/80px-Unit_SN.jpg" />  <div class="thumbcaption">Sniper</div></div></div>

The sniper has the slowest time to kill of all the direct fire weapons, but it has infinite range and is much less affected by range than other units. In mid and close-range a sniper will usually lose, but it'll easily win at long range if the enemy doesn't flee in time. Like all direct fire units, it'll fire automatically unless instructed otherwise.

*   Base kill time: 1600ms

*   Turn delay: 352ms

*   Range: Longer than the diagonal of any generated map.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Grenade_Launcher">Grenade Launcher</span>

<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:82px;"><img src="images/thumb/0/0c/Unit_GL.jpg/80px-Unit_GL.jpg" />  <div class="thumbcaption">Grenade Launcher</div></div></div>

The Grenade Launcher fires a grenade that can bounce off the surrounding terrain. The grenade will not bounce off the edges of the map, but it can be aimed to land outside the map boundaries and will still kill enemies in the area of effect. To fire the Grenade Launcher, the player must use the aim function. The Grenade Launcher does not fire automatically. The Grenade Launcher produces an area effect explosion when the grenade goes off. The Grenade Launcher has a slow rate of fire and takes 0.8 seconds to launch a grenade. A propelled grenade will take 3 seconds to detonate. Grenades will not destroy terrain within their blast radius.

*   Animation length: 0.8s

*   Cooldown: 4.2s

*   Range: 35 tiles

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Rocket_Launcher">Rocket Launcher</span>

<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:82px;"><img src="images/thumb/1/1f/Unit_RL.jpg/80px-Unit_RL.jpg" />  <div class="thumbcaption">Rocket Launcher</div></div></div>

The Rocket Launcher fires a rocket at a designated target. The Rocket Launcher cannot directly hit an enemy and must instead be aimed at the surrounding terrain. Enemy soldiers can be killed in the resulting explosion. The area effect for the Rocket Launcher is the same as the Grenade Launcher. The Rocket Launcher has a slow rate of fire, takes 0.65 to launch a rocket and can only fire every 5 seconds. To hit half-height obstacles the Rocket Launcher has to duck. Rockets will destroy the terrain within their blast radius. The rockets will not explode if they hit the edges of the playing field, but will instead fly away harmlessly.

*   Animation length: 0.65s

*   Cooldown: 4.35s

*   Range: Infinite

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Riot_Shield">Riot Shield</span>

<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:82px;"><img src="images/thumb/f/fe/Riot_shield.jpg/80px-Riot_shield.jpg" />  <div class="thumbcaption">Riot Shield</div></div></div>

The Riot Shield unit is a new unit added in the first expansion, Red. This unit has no weapon, but produces a bulletproof shield in the direction it is facing/aiming while standing still. This has obvious defensive capabilities, however can be put to effective offensive use when combined with a Grenade Launcher. Grenades will bounce off the shield, making Grenade Launcher and Riot Shield a very powerful unit combination. The shield, however, does not protect from explosions, so don't stand too close to the grenade's intended target. If a rocket hits the shield, it doesn't bounce off, but explodes like it would when hitting a wall.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Campaign_Special_Units_.28POSSIBLE_SPOILERS.29">Campaign Special Units (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)</span>

In the campaign, there are a number of special units, not found anywhere else.

*   The Commando: Essentially, a faster shotgun.

*   The Devastator: An extremely fast Rocket Launcher capable of firing multiple times in a turn.

*   Civilians: Unarmed units. When hostile friendly units will open fire on them but they will never attack back.
