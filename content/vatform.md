title: Vatform

_The text below is taken from the in-game 'vatform overview' dossier._

Vatforms are organisms created from cloned human tissue.

Their cognitive function is severely limited, leaving them to function mostly on reflex and simple logical connections.

Most vatforms are used for menial tasks, or those too dangerous to be undertaken by humans.

Another major use is tissue for transplantation or treatment of disease.

The technology is largely absent outside [[markov-geist.md|Markov Geist]], with many other municipalities resisting vatform development on ethical grounds.

Although not yet widespread, Enyo:Nomad has spearheaded vatform technology and employed it in the creation of a significant workforce, linking the vatform mass directly to [[charon%27s-palm.md|Charon's Palm]].

The other major vatform producer is the [[panarch-collaborative.md|Panarch Collaborative]]: they believe that vatforms with basic shape technology attached are the fastest means of building a new society.
