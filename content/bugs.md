title: Bugs

Use this page to record any bugs you find. Try and provide as much information as you can. Bugs should use the following template:

*   Description: A description of exactly what happens / doesn't happen. A picture would be nice.

*   Game Type/Level: The gamemode(s) the bug happens in. (Campaign Mission #no; Extermination/Disputed...; Co-op etc.)

*   Expansion: Do you (or both if co-op) have Red?

*   OS: The operating system and version you are running - if co-op, supply both.

*   Reproducible: Can you reproduce the bug? How?

*   Game ID: Game ID(s) that the bug happened in, if possible/applicable.

*   Name: Your IRC/in-game username
