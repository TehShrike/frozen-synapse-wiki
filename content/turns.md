title: Turns

<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:250px;"><img src="images/1/13/Interface.PNG" />  <div class="thumbcaption">Part of the in-game interface which lets the user know: Players participating, their level and status; the colour they are playing as; the game mode; whether it is light or dark; the maximum turn limit (16 in this example).</div></div></div>

In a game of Frozen Synapse, players take turns to [[making-a-plan.md|create a plan]] for their units. Once both players have committed their turns (By hitting the _Prime_ button at the bottom of the screen) units from both teams will move along their respective paths and follow issued commands. The number of turns available in a given match is shown in the top right of the interface.

When an unit is ordered to [[continue-on-sight.md|Engage on Sight]], is standing still or is given the aim command, then it will target and begin to fire upon a hostile unit if it crosses it's line of sight. What determines the winner of a firefight are the [[principles-of-combat.md|Principles of Combat]].

By default, a turn lasts for **5 seconds.** It is important to take into consideration what is capable of being achieved within that time and what will require multiple turns to achieve. Be aware that a turn may not go according to plan from a simulation, and even if you think you've taken into consideration everything in which your opponent could do, this does not mean your opponent will follow any one of the simulations and could perform something completely unexpected. 



## <span class="mw-headline" id="Number_of_turns_per_game_mode"> Number of turns per game mode </span>

Each game mode have a different set amount of turns, where the match will be concluded on the last turn. If a match reaches its turn limit, then the winner is determined by their [[scoring.md|score]]. The following is a list of the current game modes and their default turn limit:

*   Extermination: 8 Turns

*   Secure: 6 Turns

*   Disputed: 16 turns

*   Hostage: 8 turns

*   Charge: 6 Turns

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Multiple_turn_events"> Multiple turn events </span>

**The following list of events cannot be interrupted and may last for multiple turns:**

*   Propelled grenades.

*   Propelled rockets.

*   Hostage/s which have moved from their starting zone and are in the process of escaping in [[hostage.md|hostage]].

Once a rocket or grenade has been propelled, they take a set amount of time to explode. A grenade will explode 3 seconds after being launched, and a rocket will explode when it hits a walls. While rockets have a variable time, they travel faster than grenades and generally will explode on the same turn if fired at the start of the turn. 

If you plan to fire a grenade or a rocket, it is best to do it as close to the start of the turn as possible to minimise the chances of your opponent from manouvering away. If there is a rocket or grenade heading towards one of your units, and they do not explode before the next turn, use this chance to immediately move the units as far away from the explosion area as reasonably possible to maximise chances of surviving. (be sure to simulate each method of retreat to see which is the most optimal).

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Things_to_watch_out_for_before_committing_a_turn"> Things to watch out for before committing a turn </span>

There are many things your opponent could do which you may not of expected. For example, if you a planning an ambush by flanking but he/she knows where your units are or has a good estimation of where they approximately are, then he/she may plan accordingly and retreat into a more advantageous position. As another example, if your opponent has a rocket trooper, you may be anticipating a rocket to be propelled towards cover near your units but you may not expect a rocket to explode elsewhere granting the enemy [[line-of-sight.md|Line of Sight]] to your units. 

**Be careful!** Even if your oppenet does move according to plan on a turn, the results may still be unexpected. This can happen from minor, unforeseen actions such as the enemy moving a unit slightly closer to half cover, giving it just enough time to take down one of your units moving from cover to cover.
