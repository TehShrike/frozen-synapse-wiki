title: Cover

There are two types of cover in Frozen Synapse:

*   Half Height Walls
*   Full Height Walls


## <span class="mw-headline" id="Half_Height_Cover_and_Line_of_Sight"> Half Height Cover and Line of Sight </span>

These are shown on the map as a light blue, translucent area. If a [[unit-types.md|unit]] is ducked next to a half wall it becomes "hidden" to the area in front of the half height wall, meaning enemy units **can't** see, or shoot at, that unit as there is no [[line-of-sight.md|Line of Sight]]. However, the same applies to your unit, so your unit will not be able to see "over" the half wall and will therefore not notice enemy units or shoot at them.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Half_Height_Combat"> Half Height Combat </span>

If any unit is standing in front of a half height wall it will receive a bonus to combat making it harder to hit, so the [[principles-of-combat.md|Time to Kill]] will be increased, making the unit behind cover more likely to win or have time to move away from the situation. Half height walls also block grenade damage, partially when standing and completely when ducking. This means that while standing a grenade must be much closer for it to kill if you're behind cover, and if you're ducking it has to be on your side of the cover.

To be precise, cover will only work out to your advantage if your opponent is at least twice as far from the cover as you. If you're more than twice as far away, it works out in his advantage. If you're between 0.5 and 2.0 away in relation to your enemy, you're both inconvenienced equally.

Do note that the V hotkey across cover does _not_ indicate if cover applies, only if you'd be able to see a ducked unit.

A [[unit-types.md|grenade launcher]] is able to fire over a half height wall both when ducked and standing, but only if the grenade has traveled less than half of its trajectory. If it has traveled more than half its trajectory, the grenade will bounce off of the half height wall as if it were a full height wall.

A [[unit-types.md|rocket launcher]] is able to fire over a half height wall, however the unit **must** be standing and the rocket will travel over any half height walls (that is, it won't lose height at all) it encounters on its journey, however, if a rocket launcher is ducked when it fires the rocket will explode when it comes in contact with half height walls, and any unit directly behind it or very close will also die in the explosion.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Full_Height_Walls"> Full Height Walls </span>

A regular wall is an opaque, dark blue area. This is a "full" wall, and it completely blocks Line of Sight, meaning you can't see or shoot through it. Full height walls do not count as cover when it comes to Time to Kill. If a grenade hits a full height wall, it will bounce off, however a rocket will explode on contact - regardless of whether the [[unit-types.md|rocket launcher]] is crouching.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_Uses"> Basic Uses </span>

Half height walls can be extremely useful, as a unit that is standing behind it that has enemy attention can simply duck, wait, and stand, wait, duck, stand, etc. which can distract enemy units from other units you have without them killing it. This can both be used to get other units to safety, or to kill enemy units while they're distracted.
