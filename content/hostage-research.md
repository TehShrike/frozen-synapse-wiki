title: Hostage Research

adam_0 is doing research on what some players believe to be imbalances in the [[hostage.md|hostage]] game mode, specifically that it is too easy for the hostages to escape.



## <span class="mw-headline" id="Current_problems"> Current problems </span>

*   Hostages move rather quickly, and can get behind cover rather quickly and avoid being shot. In most maps, the hostages can make a break for the escape and reach it within 2 turns

*   The ratio of attacker units vs defender units can range from 2:3 to 3:4. The difference between those two ratios could mean quite a difference in the outcome of the game, although this is largely untested

*   The composition of attacker vs defender units can vary, making it difficult to accurately assess the alleged imbalance of the game

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Current_escape_ratio"> Current escape ratio </span>

According to Omroth, as of 13:52 on 2011-06-15, player 1 (the hostage rescuer) had won 3006 of 4559 hostage games (about two-thirds).

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Suggested_potential_fixes"> Suggested potential fixes </span>

*   Shorten the turn length to make it easier to react to the hostages running

*   Experiment with different numbers and kinds of units for the attackers and defenders

*   Larger maps (to make it take more turns for the hostages to escape)

*   Slightly slower hostages

*   Smaller hostage box

*   Alter map generation so that the hostage box always exists in a single room (i.e. that there are several places from which the entire box is visible).

*   Attacker Must get into the starting area (untie them) in order to move the hostages

*   Tie the number of attackers to the number of escape zones

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Experimentation"> Experimentation </span>

There is a [Google spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/lH1fiz) available with the games that have been played. If you play a hostage game, please record the information on the spreadsheet.

Games will be especially useful if they exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:

*   Fairly normal [[unit-types.md|unit types]] and compositions on both sides. This allows us to compare games apples to apples.

*   Shorter turn durations. This can be customized by making an advanced game. I am currently experimenting with 4 second turns

*   Somewhat even abilities. We'll normalize for this eventually, but the games are much more likely to give meaningful statistics when it's two experienced hostage players playing

Thanks!
