The Advanced Setup can be accessed by navigating through Multiplayer &gt; Create Game &gt; Advanced Setup. Levels made with the Advanced Setup can only be played by challenging another player or accepting a challenge using a custom level, and not via the standard [[matchmaking.md|Matchmaking]] procedure.

Not to be confused with the [[level-editor.md|Level Editor]].



## <span class="mw-headline" id="Load_Level.2FSave_Level">Load Level/Save Level</span>

Levels can be loaded from and saved to "..\frozen synapse\psychoff\data\userlevels".

## <span class="editsection">[[">edit](/index.php?title=Advanced_Setup&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2 "Advanced_Setup&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2")]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Generate_.3CMap_Type.3E">Generate &lt;Map Type&gt;</span>

These buttons allow you to randomly generate a map based on the rules of each game type. 

1.  [[extermination.md|Extermination]]: 3-4 [[unit-types.md|units]] per team

2.  [[secure.md|Secure]]: 2-4 units per team, secure zones

3.  [[disputed.md|Disputed]]: 3-5 units per team, drop off zones

4.  [[hostage.md|Hostage]]: 3 green units and 2 red units _or_ 4 green units and 3 red units, 2 hostages, hostage spawn zone, terrorist start zone, hostage endzone

5.  [[charge.md|Charge]]: 3-4 units per team, yard lines

6.  Symmetrical: Generates a symmetrical map with symmetrical unit placement, no specific game zones or markers

## <span class="editsection">[[">edit](/index.php?title=Advanced_Setup&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3 "Advanced_Setup&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3")]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Add_.3CUnit_Type.3E">Add &lt;Unit Type&gt;</span>

Adds a randomly placed unit of the specified type to the board. The unit will be on the green team by default, unless the "Add for red team" checkbox is filled. Units can then be selected and moved around the map.(done by click and drag)

The units will not get placed on the level in a symmetrical way, so if you are creating a symmetrical level you will have to move the units to where you want them to stand.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Delete_Selected_Unit">Delete Selected Unit</span>

Deletes/removes the selected unit from the level.(Selecting a unit is done by left-clicking on it once)

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Submit">Submit</span>

Submits the created level, allows you to choose further options:

1.  Game mode: One of the 5 game modes

2.  Vis mode (Fog of War settings): full (both players always see all units), vis at time zero (both players see all units at the beginning of turn 1), only on sight (you only see units which is in your line of sight)

3.  Opponent: You must fill this out. Type the name of the person you wish to play against, this will issue that person a challenge. "Open" does not work.

4.  I play side 1/2: Choose to play as green or red.

5.  Turn limit: Number of turns before the match ends.

6.  Turn Length: Amount of time for each turn (in milliseconds: 1 second = 1000 ms)

When finished, press submit to challenge your chosen opponent. Be warned, however, that fiddling with the settings too much can cause some very broken games.
