title: Game ID

Each game is assigned a unique Game ID. 

Often on the [IRC](irc://irc.maxgaming.net:6667/#mode7games) or in the [forums](http://forums.mode7games.com/) people will refer to a game by its Game ID. If you are posting a bug report, asking a question about a specific game or otherwise want to reference a specific game, then specifying the game's ID along with your question/comment is the easiest way for others to look up what you want them to look up.
