Bidding is the first turn in [[charge.md|Charge]] and [[secure.md|Secure]] maps. Both players bid for territory in order to take on the role of either the attacker or the defender, with the bid winner being the one who bids most aggressively.

In Charge, the areas of bidding are laid out in bars like shown to in the image to the right. The objective is to bid farther down the field than your opponent, earning the role of the attacker. If you lose, you take the role of the defender. You get a higher [[scoring.md|score]] for winning a game with a larger bid, which encourages optimistic bidding.

[[unit-types.md|Snipers]], [[unit-types.md|rocket launchers]], and [[unit-types.md|grenade launchers]] are often superior units on a charge map due to their range and / or destruction capabilities. Compare your relative range to your enemy's and bid based upon your ability to move forward unhindered.

In secure, the areas of bidding are various sizes of boxes in areas around the map.  You must select one or more of these to prime. The player who loses the bid must attack the winning bidder's area, starting in the red boxes displayed on the first turn. Like charge, you are rewarded more for bids of larger areas, which encourages optimistic bidding.

If you have a sniper rifle in a more open map (or simply your units out-range his), take a corner of the map and hold your ground.

An underused strategy is to attack the enemy, if you have the proper units for doing so. Often secure maps, especially dark ones, lead to camping that results in the attacker eventually breaking through. By taking the fight to the enemy, you can make sure that he doesn't have enough time to prepare a strike.
