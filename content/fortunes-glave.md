title: Fortune's Glave

_Taken from the dossier on Fortune's Glave._

This Nin splinter organisation operates a strict code of conduct.

Trust must be earned through good works and financial donations: members are judged on the strength of their actions alone.  

Initiates must serve a probationary term of two years before being fully inducted into the Glave: during this time they are forbidden to speak to non-members.  By associating only with other Glave insiders, a culture of extreme loyalty and dedication is fostered.

Each initiate is nominated by the head of a ruling family in [[markov-geist.md|Denshen]].  

Fortune's Glave itself operates as a form of council and security force, maintaining order while overtly attacking Enyo:Nomad.

Its origins in policing the petty gang squabbles of Denshen have led it to adopt a paternalistic mindset: Glave members believe the city requires an over-arching form of discipline to contain its excesses.

Aggressively passionate, this faction is famed for its plain speech and swift action.

While always keen to protect their own interests, it is not unknown for Glave members to forge alliances with other factions in the city.  Such arrangements are mostly short-term, however.
