Hostage is the [[game-modes.md|game mode]] where one player (hostage-taker or HT) is keeping the hostages or killing them if they try to escape, and the other player (Rescuer) is trying to clear a way for the hostages to reach safety.

The Hostages always start in a small square near the middle of the map, and they can not be killed until they move out of that square. Their escape zones are noted by lines drawn when a hostage is selected.

If you are the Hostage Taker: you can move your unit around in the large square in the middle by dragging them, as well as plan orders for them.

If you are the Rescuer: You can move your unit around in a small zone on one of the borders of the map, as well as plan orders for them. You can move the hostages inside their starting box.

After the first turn, the rescuer can also give orders to the hostages.

Make sure you send them to the right exit area!  The only walls they can exit at are the ones that they are indicated by a green line, when you click on a hostage.

Remember that once your hostage leaves its starting zone, you must **plan a complete escape route that goes all the way to an exit**, as once they leave their starting zone you cannot give further commands to them. The hostages can complete multi-turn maneuvers.  After the first turn, you can move hostages around within their starting zone without having to plan their entire escape, as long you ensure they do not leave it.  Doing so will not let your opponent target your hostages and is useful for scouting unit locations in dark mode.

The game will end after 8 turns, unless it ends earlier due to one of the situations described below.

The Hostage Taker wins if they: Kill all the hostages before they reach safety (after leaving the start square). All the enemy units can be dead and if the hostages escape you will still lose.

The Rescuer wins if they: Eliminate all enemy units, or are able to get one or both of the hostages to the exit zone.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Scoring"> Scoring </span>

The scoring is based on the number of hostages rescued by the Rescuer or the number killed/not escaped by the Hostage Taker. Hostages are 25points each. The max score is 50.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Tips_and_Tricks"> Tips and Tricks </span>

This is partly a game of tactics and partly a game of "guess when the hostages will/should run for it". Master that and you will do much better.

Sending the hostages in two different directions can increase their chance of survival, as can going from cover to cover. If you're the hostage-takers it can be a good idea, especially in Dark mode, to have one unit defending the hostages after the first turn.

Hostages do provide [[line-of-sight.md|line of sight]] but until they are given orders, they are stuck facing their initial direction.  You can give the hostages orders to run around inside the small square, in order to see a bit more of the map.  As long as the hostages do not leave the safe square, you can still give them new orders on subsequent turns.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Game_imbalance"> Game imbalance </span>

Some experienced players consider hostage to be the most potentially imbalanced game mode.  For more information, or to find out about experimenting with the game balance, see [[hostage-research.md|Hostage Research]].
