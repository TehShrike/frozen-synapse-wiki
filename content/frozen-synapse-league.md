## <span class="mw-headline" id="About">About</span>

The Frozen Synapse League or FSL is a [[community.md|community]] run unofficial competition league for Frozen Synapse, at the moment it is discontinued indefinitely.

At the end of each season, polls are created based on player feedback. This then determines changes or additions to the rules for next season. In this way, players have control over how the league is run and played by majority vote.

Joining the league is easy. Just register a username on the website and go to the league standings. Once there click on the relevant league and join it. Players should note that joining a league is only available at the start of the season. Once the season has begun, the league is closed to new players. Players that miss out on a league because the league is full are entered into another division.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Media">Media</span>

The FSL website has a component that allows players to enter their favorite league or non-league YouTube videos. This creates a place where players can review tactics used in winning games and enjoy well played games as they desire. The ability to comment on videos is also available.
