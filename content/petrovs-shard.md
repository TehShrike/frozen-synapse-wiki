title: Petrov's Shard

_Text below is taken from the in-game dossier on Petrov's Shard._

[[campaign.md|Graham Nix]] formed Petrov's Shard after his less-than-amicable split with Enyo:Nomad.

His aim was to create an independent organisation to prevent the monopolisation of political power by any single entity.

Using personal funds accrued during the merger of Enyo and Nomad, he started to build a private militia.  Stolen Enyo:Nomad technology (notably, the tactical system Petrov's Prism) would enable him to gain a significant advantage over other rival groups.

A vast network of underworld contacts, combined with a certain fast-paced adaptability, meant that Petrov's Shard quickly grew into a key player in the ecology of [[markov-geist.md|Markov Geist]].

Nix's experience with shapeforms allowed him to win the favour of [[campaign.md|Belacqua]], a renegade research construct-gone-bad who had been excised from his former role due to his abrasive personality.  While only a minor shapeform, Belacqua's interdiction and tactical skills caused him to become a key asset for Nix.
