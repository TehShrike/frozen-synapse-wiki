title: Suggested Modes

This page is for suggesting entirely new game modes.



## <span class="mw-headline" id="VIP.2FAssassination"> VIP/Assassination </span>

Quite simply, one team has a civilian they need to protect. They have to keep the civilian alive for x turns (possibly decided by bidding). If the civilian dies before then, they lose. If they kill all enemies before then, they win. If the turn-limit is decided by bidding, the defenders should start off somewhat worse than the attackers so that it doesn't just turn into [[extermination.md|Extermination]].

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Zombie_Horde_.28single_player.29"> Zombie Horde (single player) </span>

Like Secure you start in a small room in the center of the map. Waves of zombies spawn near the edge of the map and wander in. Each turn N*2 more zombies spawn, how many turns can you keep the zombies from entering your safe house?!

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Zombie_Horde_.28multiplayer.29"> Zombie Horde (multiplayer) </span>

Each player gets three units with which to defend a room. The room has multiple entrances, and possibly windows. Each turn, more zombies spawn, some with weapons. Eventually, zombies may obtain methods to destroy terrain, further increasing the survival difficulty. The game can either be survival, or Secure.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Capture_the_Flag"> Capture the Flag </span>

Like various campaign missions, on each side of a field (symmetrical or otherwise) there are one or more flags. The flag(s) must be returned to a drop-off point three times to win. Random troops spawn for each player every ten seconds (regardless of turn length) up to five troops per team. Or downed players could respawn after a set amount of time within some safe zone (would need some way to avoid/offset spawn camping)

## <span class="mw-headline" id="One_Flag_CTF"> One Flag CTF </span>

Played on a long map (as in Charge), with units spawning at opposite ends. The game is essentially Disputed with a single box and the exit point for your units restricted to the far end of the map, where your enemy spawned; you win by picking up the box and extracting it to the other side of the map. If the unit carrying the box is killed this could either force a draw (again, similar to Disputed) or then drop the box in place/respawn it.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Dual_Bomb_plant_mode"> Dual Bomb plant mode </span>

one random area near center is designated as bomb site, highlighted in white color. Both teams start with bomb. Any player if stands in bomb site for 3.0 seconds indicated that bomb has been planted, the color of area changes to team color which was successful in making the plant. In next 6 turns, those who planted must defend it, while the team that failed to plant must defuse it by going in the bomb site and remain alive for 3.0 seconds to make the defuse.
if before bomb is planted, all members of a team die then other team wins. after bomb plant, even if defenders die.. attackers must still defuse the bomb to win.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Single_Bomb_plant_mode"> Single Bomb plant mode </span>

in this only one team gets the bomb, but there are two bomb sites. The attackers must plant at any one bomb site by staying inside the white bomb zone for 3.0 second. and that bomb site changes to team color. The defenders must stop attackers from making the plant for 10 turns, or if they made the plant then defuse the bomb in next 6 turns to win.
if before bomb is planted, all members of a team die then other team wins. after bomb plant, even if defenders die.. attackers must still defuse the bomb to win.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="1_v_1_v_1"> 1 v 1 v 1 </span>

Multiple tactical teams competing in a single extermination. Also 1v1v1v1, etc. Teaming capability would be a plus.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Juggernaut"> Juggernaut </span>

Like elimination except one player controls the Juggernaut.  The Juggernaut is a slow moving assault vehicle with superior weaponry and hit points but inferior mobility and stealth.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Reverse_Juggernaut.2FNinja"> Reverse Juggernaut/Ninja </span>

One player controls a player with superior mobility and stealth, but less hit points. Could be like extermination where one team must defeat the other, or could have some objective to assault/defend.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Flush"> Flush </span>

Starts with a bidding system identical to Secure, except the less territory you bid the better. Lets call the bid winner Green Team and the bid loser Red Team. Red Team's goal is to either kill all of Green Team or to get all of the Green Team units out of the bidded zone for three straight seconds before seven turns are up. If they manage that, the roles are reversed, and Red Team has to enter and hold the bidded area for an additional five turns. Numbers are changeable, of course.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Freeze_modes"> Freeze modes </span>

Might work with any game mode. When a unit dies, it freezes. You can thaw the frozen units by standing next to him for some period of time (2-3 seconds possibly). Could be played as 1 round freeze tag in extermination or could be added to other game modes (like light / dark). If you have some job to do, you have to decide do you need your dead unit more or do you need to finish the job. Would have to decide do the units just thaw at to the place they died in or spawn to a new location. In Frozen Synapse I think spawning to the same location might be better.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Paintball_mode"> Paintball mode </span>

Frozen Synapse is an excellent and thoughtful strategy game but perhaps too violent for playing around kids.  Proposed paintball doesn't do anything except for change the death animation from bleeding, screaming, and falling over to getting covered in paint, throwing hands in the air, and jogging off the side of the map.  Maybe no rocket launchers (although paint grenades sounds awesome).

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Offline_Matchmaking"> Offline Matchmaking </span>

Offline Matchmaking allows a player to set "I want X games active" and every night at an appointed time, the server will match games until the player has all of the requested games active, instead of waiting for two people to be online at the same time - the unique feature of the game, that it's playable in discrete chunks, means people aren't routinely looking for matches at any given times.
