The Mode 7 IRC channel **#mode7games** on **irc.maxgaming.net**.  You should stop by!  It's a lot of fun.



## <span class="mw-headline" id="Private_message_one_on_one"> Private message one on one </span>

To open private chat with other user use _/msg &lt;otherNick&gt; &lt;message&gt;_. First word after /msg will be used as the recipient, everything else goes in the message. This will open a new personal room with the recipient if (s)he exists. If you wish to include more users in one chat, you will need to create a channel.

Example: 

*   /msg shapeform You are a comely lass.

2.  Typing "Chanwindow.canmove=1" (without quotes) and pressing &lt;enter&gt;

If you wish to join to a channel, you can type _/join #&lt;channel&gt;_. If the channel does not exist it will be created and you will be elevated to operator status. Some channels are password protected, and in such cases you have to provide the password at the end of the join command.

Example: 

*   /join #MyOwnChannel

*   /join #Paranoidfriendschannel ridiculouslylongandhardpassword

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Leaving_or_parting_from_channel"> Leaving or parting from channel </span>

It is possible to leave specific channels. To do so, write _/part &lt;channel&gt; [&lt;reason&gt;]_. The reason provided will be displayed in the leave message.

Example: 

*   /part #mode7games

*   /part #channelwithfriends  gg
