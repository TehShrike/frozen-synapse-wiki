title: Co-op

<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:402px;"><img src="images/thumb/5/51/Map_coop.jpg/400px-Map_coop.jpg" />  <div class="thumbcaption">A typical co-op game.</div></div></div>

Both campaigns (vanilla and Red), the challenge missions that come with Red, and all other singleplayer content can all be played co-operatively against the AI. Only one player requires Red to play co-op: the player with Red creates the game, and invites whoever they like to be their opponent.

At first glance, a co-op game looks very similar to a normal game, however there are two notable differences. First, there are three different coloured units, as opposed to the usual two. Red is the enemy, like normal. Green units are your own, and yellow units are your partner's.

Secondly, there are two new buttons below the information in the top-right: 'Share Plan' and 'Ping', which do pretty much what they say.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Playing_Co-op">Playing Co-op</span>

A co-op game is played in exactly the same way as a standard game, but with the addition of another player helping you. You make your [[making-a-plan.md|plan]] like you normally would, however instead of priming right away you share your plans with your partner by pressing the 'Share Plan' button. Your partner cannot see your plans until you press this button. This notifies them in the bottom left corner of the screen, and shows them your plans. When your partner shares their plans, the same will happen for you.

The Share Plan system allows you to only share your plans with your partner when you are happy with them, instead of confusing your partner with your thought processes. When you are both happy with your plans, prime like you would normally and the turn will play out.

Co-op games do not require both players to be there all the time: when you share your plan, the other player will recieve it the next time they view the game. Similarly, you do not have to play the whole game in one go - you can play other games too, or quit Frozen Synapse entirely. The game will appear in the games list in the bottom corner like a normal match.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Pinging">Pinging</span>

You can ping a specific location on the map by pressing the 'Ping' button and then clicking the location on the map. This flashes a marker in that area, alerting your partner. This makes communicating locations much easier than saying "The second window in the third building from the top right"
