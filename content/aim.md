## <span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_Principles"> Basic Principles </span>

For most [[unit-types.md|units]], this command focuses their attention in a fixed direction in order to decrease [[principles-of-combat.md|kill time]] against enemy units encountered within the prioritized direction.  The command will stay active and keep the unit focused on the selection direction until cancelled.  If a unit moves whilst aiming, its movement speed is reduced. Unlike standard movement, [[line-of-sight.md|Line of Sight]] is linked to the direction the unit is aiming rather than the direction they are moving when they are under the influence of an Aim order

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Using_the_Aim_Command"> Using the Aim Command </span>

This section refers to use of the Aim command on the Sniper, Shotgun and Machine Gun units.  The Aim command functions differently for Grenade Launcher and Rocket Launcher units, and these are explained in the next section. The Aim command is initiated by clicking and dragging the green crosshair found at the upper left corner of a selected [[move.md|waypoint]].  As you drag the crosshair, a visual representation will show you the area the unit is focused on.  The combat bonus is applied against all enemy units within this zone.

The following orders influence the Aim command in one manner or another

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Continue_on_Sight">Continue on Sight</span>

After selecting [[continue-on-sight.md|Continue on Sight]] a unit's aim command is cancelled and the unit will behave as per the Continue on Sight order.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Cancel_Aim">Cancel Aim</span>

After selecting cancel aim, the unit will return to its default behavior. The aim bonus is lost, movement speed increases and [[line-of-sight.md|Line of Sight]] becomes linked to the direction of movement.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Check">Check</span>

The [[check.md|Check]] command functions as normal whilst a unit is under the influence of an Aim command.  Once the unit has finished checking, they return to the existing Aim behavior. Of note, a unit appears to keep its aim bonus whilst Checking under the influence of an Aim order

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Using_Aim_with_Rocket_.26_Grenade_Launchers"> Using Aim with Rocket &amp; Grenade Launchers </span>

[[unit-types.md|Rocket Launcher]] and [[unit-types.md|Grenade Launcher]] units function differently under the Aim command.  These units do not engage enemy units automatically, and have to be explicitly told when to fire.  The Aim command is the channel through which this is done.  As with standard units, you initiate the Aim command by clicking on and dragging the green crosshair at the upper left of a selected waypoint.  When you do this for these units you will see a green trajectory line that will show you the flight path of the grenade or missile.  The unit will stand still on the spot the Aim order was issued until they take their shot. Unlike the default Aim order, once a missile or grenade unit has fired their shot, the aim order is cancelled automatically and the unit resumes normal behavior and movement.

*   When approaching a window, don't approach it directly.  Approach to the side of the window, walk right up against the wall and then Aim your unit towards the room and "strafe" past the window. This will ensure that you break line of sight for any enemies in the room and provide you with aim and cover bonuses against any enemies you engage on the other side.

*   Aiming impacts your Line of Sight, so in Dark mode matches you may not see an enemy if you are aiming in the wrong direction.  Depending the map, make sure you use Aim or the Continue on Sight/Check combination to give yourself Line of Sight to other areas from time to time, to stop the enemy getting the drop on you. Be careful using Aim to do this, as you will engage any enemy that you see, which is bad news if they're behind cover
