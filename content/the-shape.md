title: The Shape

_The text below is from the dossier on the Shape._

The shape began as a communications network: complex servers ricocheting data over tense wires.  With a combination of wireless technology and organic computation, the possibilities spiraled.

Soon, connecting to the shape became as natural as breath; it was allowed to pervade life.  Shape descriptors - devices or entities which radiate the shape - sprang up throughout the city.

The shape is not evenly distributed; it clusters around "nodes", areas of higher bandwidth which offer a more profound shape experience.

Originally, human operators required training to fully utilise the shape.  Then, the Nomad Group introduced FRIEND, a system which diluted the experience into something much more accessible.

A fully immersive virtual reality caused dissonance for many; compulsive shape users retreated from the real into a world comprised solely of abstracts, ideals and projections.

High-functioning individuals embraced this, but used the shape more as a tool for augmentation than escape.
