Frozen Synapse has several game modes players can pick from. Each mode has two variations; [[dark-mode.md|Dark]] and [[light-mode.md|Light]].

*   [[extermination.md|Extermination]]; Usual deathmatch mode

*   [[secure.md|Secure]]; One player has to defend an area on the map, the other has to reach that area

*   [[disputed.md|Disputed]]; Both players have to collect boxes and bring them to safety

*   [[hostage.md|Hostage]]; One player has to free hostages, the other prevent the freeing

*   [[charge.md|Charge]]; One player has to reach a line near the opposite side of the map, the other defend the line

The first expansion pack, Red, adds one additional mode:

*   Upload; Each player has a hacker - kill your opponent's before they kill yours.
