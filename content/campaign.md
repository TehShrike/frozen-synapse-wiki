title: Campaign

The campaign is a series of single-player missions that together tell the story of the game. It's considered a secondary focus of the game, with the multiplayer as the main focus.

There are 55 missions in total, usually occurring in sets of three per location.  At the beginning of each chapter, the player is given a view of the map of Markov Geist, which then zooms in to the contested area.  In this view, the player can read the continually updating news reel for in-game events, click on the portraits of available characters for a brief, one-sided discussion with them, read informational dossiers unlocked by progress through the campaign, or start the current operation.

**Note**: the below sections will include **spoilers** for the sake of completeness.  There will be a notification at the beginning of sections meant to contain major spoilers for the game.  For all other sections, written descriptions will be made adequately vague and open-ended to prevent the inclusion of major game spoilers; however, names and the presence or absence of other data may give away certain parts of the plot.



## <span class="mw-headline" id="Chapters">Chapters</span>

The campaign is divided into 19 chapters. Each chapter is comprised of a certain number of missions, usually 3. These missions correspond to an engagement with a well-defined objective, often mimicking what you can expect from a game of one of the multiplayer [[game-modes.md|game modes]]: [[extermination.md|Extermination]], [[disputed.md|Disputed]], [[secure.md|Secure]], [[hostage.md|Hostage]] and [[charge.md|Charge]].
The overall campaign features the player as Tactics, a tactical analyst and his relation with a small urban resistance group called [[petrov%27s-shard.md|Petrov's Shard]], an underground urban resistance group bent on overthrowing Enyo:Nomad's hold on [[markov-geist.md|Markov Geist]] through the shape.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Nashar">Nashar</span>

The campaign begins with Tactics being asked to extract a high profile sleeper agent from Enyo:Nomad. The agent, [[campaign.md|Kate Soulsby]], joins you afterwards.

**Hints (contains spoilers)**

**1. Incursion**

The very first mission should be fairly easy to achieve. Just use the fast movement of your units and blow the Shapeforms away.  If you find yourself being ambushed, stay out of open areas and choreograph your commandos so they don't stop moving before the turn is over.

**2. Massacre**

Just position your machine gun units in open field and move around your shotgun guys. You should be able to gun the workers down in about two turns.

**3. Extraction**

Shapeforms will approach from the top and bottom edges (some more appear in upcoming turns). So make sure you hunt them down quickly. Try to keep your units (at least one) near Kate and it should be fairly straight forward.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Power_Plant">Power Plant</span>

Next up in Petrov's Shard plan of subversive actions is taking over a power plant from Enyo:Nomad control, so that your allies, the Panarchs, can increase their vatform production to be able to support the following military actions.

**Hints (contains spoilers)**

**4. Incursion**

First real mission where you have to plan your steps. Use covers as much as possible, duck your units if they would have disadvantage in shooting and use your shotgun for short-range fire.

**5. The Hack**

You have to hold a room for 6 turns. The neutral units are there for some silly help. Place your units the way you handle incoming shapeforms easily. You may get the shotgunner back into the zone and check any directions for incoming units.

**6. Assassination**

First level with rocket launchers. Try to take'em out as soon as possible. He will destroy your cover and you would have to stand in open field. Again, use your shotgunners to kill the enemies from small distance. Your only real target is Bradshaw. Concentrate one unit on him (use continue on sight where applicable)

### <span class="mw-headline" id="The_Studio">The Studio</span>

Nix wants to broadcast a statement designed to raise awareness of how Enyo:Nomad is using the shape to control the population. Your goal is to coordinate the attack on the station and ensure he remains safe while he is on the air.

**Hints (contains spoilers)**

**7. Incursion**

First mission, you have to get a unit into a guarded zone. Davis must stay alive, so keep him in cover. Entering the zone is not that easy. Try to attack a single enemy in the corridors with two units together. So you should be able to gun it down (one will die likely). Prepare for some retries and use the save butt...damn...the save button is a lie!

**8. Clearance**

The enemy has a sniper and a grenadier. Beware of them and try to kill them as soon as possible, but don't rush for them. Use a short distance against the sniper and take the guy throwing grenades from short or long distance. Use the shotgun to win in close combat.

**9. Broadcast**

Your objective is to collect keys, but focus on the enemies first. Take out that rocket launcher guy quickly. Use your sniper unit over long range and open field battles. Throw grenades into likely positions but beware of blowing yourself up. Collect keys as you wish and run for the edges. You don't need to take them all to continue.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Blue_Sunlight">Blue Sunlight</span>

To maintain the alliance between Petrov's Shard and the Panarchs you have to help them curb the influence of a cult, the Blue Sunlight. In this chapter you stage an assault on one of their churches to uproot any focus of resistance and give your newfound allies breathing room for their development endeavors.

**Hints (contains spoilers)**

**10. Defend the Barracks**

Yet another mission you have to defend a zone with many windows. Even worse the shapeforms have two sniper units to kill you from distance. Use the ducking command to hide yourself and stand up at the right moment. You don't have to stay in the zone to defend. Don't blow up covering rooms near the zone with your rocket launcher. You may use it to reduce cover of the shapeforms on longer distance though. Be sure you have a machine gunner to take them down after blowing up the wall.

**11. Attack the Chapel**

You have to attack some sniper units with shotguns and there's plenty of open field there. So make sure your shotgun guys always have cover until you're in firing range to the sniper units. The have no chance in close combat. Supporting units may be used as distraction for your approach.

**12. Shape Projector Takedown**

There are some tripwires in this level. You can try to head for the control room and deactivate the tripwires, but the level normally works without it. So make your way to the room and take out the rocket launcher guy soon. This mission should be straight forward.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Cairn_Habitat">Cairn Habitat</span>

The Cairn Habitat, the main dwelling and the crowning achievement of the Panarchs has come under attack by Enyo:Nomad forces. In this chapter of the campaign you must help repel the attack.

**Hints (contains spoilers)**

**13. Defend the Habitat**

You have to defend Cairn Habitat from Enyo:Nomad forces. This is the first mission where you count with a Rocket Launcher. As any explosive unit it can cause friendly fire, beware. The Rocket Launcher unit can destroy cover, using this to your advantage to expose enemy units is a great tactic.

**14. Push Back**

You must enter a designated zone within 10 turns in order to prevent Enyo:Nomad from reinforcing. Best solution is to take out immediate opposing forces and avoid open areas since the enemy counts with a sniper unit. This should be a fairly easy level.

**15. Shape Purge**

This mission requires you to collect some data from at least 3 shape nodes and extract it to secure it. Enemy forces count with several rocket launcher units which will sure cause some havoc. You should not stop moving to avoid enemy rockets. There is an access panel which will kill the rocket units, this should be your priority, once dealt with the rocket units its much easier to take care of the remaining enemy units and collect the data. If successful, Enyo:Nomad forces will retreat from Cairn.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Novena">Novena</span>

To forge an alliance with Fortune's Glave, Nix must meet their leader, Esh, in person. You must clear the Enyo:Nomad presence in the area and see Nix to the meeting safely.

**Hints (contains spoilers)**

**16. Defend the Base**

Fortune's Glave's base is under attack and you must eliminate all but one enemy. An ally [[unit-types.md|Commando]] starts with you but it will depart after the first turn. Line-of-sight is required. Best to eliminate enemies outside the base area with the machine gun and grenade launcher while the shotgun works its way in. Grenade bouncing is helpful.

**17. Counter**

It's time to take the battle to Enyo:Nomad on this [[secure.md|Secure]] map. Reach the enemy area in the center of the map. Try to get the shotgun in immediately to take the rocket launchers out as soon as possible as they make it difficult to keep the shotgun in close range and makes cover dangerous for the machine guns. The shotgun can wipe out the center area by itself but will need machine gun assistance to take out the enemy shotgun that roams.

**18. The Meeting**

Nix is the VIP you have to protect as he makes his way across the map. Make sure your sniper has the longest line of sight. Shotgun will take care of any machine guns that get near, moving quickly to where Nix will be and using stillness as an advantage. Machine gun can get snipers by using cover and getting in close enough range to beat sniper's time to kill.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Ninstar">Ninstar</span>

The headquarters of the Ninstar has come under attack by Enyo:Nomad forces and you must help your new allies survive the attack.

**Hints (contains spoilers)**

**19. The Lobby**

The allied units under the control of the Ninstar closer to where Enyo:Nomad forces spawn are doomed, do not attempt to save them. Instead, move your Machine Guns and your Rocket Launcher around one of the sides, around the extensive walls. Whatever Ninstar forces are left will hold the choke point opposite to where the Enyo:Nomad forces start. Position your Machine Guns behind cover and use your Rocket Launcher to blow holes in the walls and small rooms until you can flank the enemy force, and force to face opposition from two sides at once. Alternatively, you can leave one Machine Gun near the Ninstar forces to confer greater strength to your two-pronged attack.

**20. Second Floor**

This mission can be quite difficult if you don't know what to do. Your goal is to defend a small area of the map. You can also try to save as many hostages as possible but given the randomness of the map and the less-than-perfect tactical assessment of said hostages, they will most likely run into enemy fire unless the maps spawns convenient cover paths. The enemy force overwhelms yours in terms of range but you have two Rocket launcher units, and using them judiciously is the key to victory. Use your Shotguns to defend the entries from places where the enemy does not have line of sight to them, and to engage stray units only if they are uncovered by enemy line of sight (this will most frequently happen if Machine Guns venture into rooms). Do **not** blow up cover in the direction you send your Shotguns. Otherwise, keep your Machine Gun behind cover and use your Rocket launcher to blow cover enough that he will have a clear and unimpeded line of sight to the other entrance. After that is done, use your Rocket Launchers to deny the enemy access to key areas of the map by constantly having them under fire. Also, in the first and second turns, try to assess which routes your enemies will take and which choke points they're likely to move their units through. One good rocket in that window of time can buy you enough breathing room for the rest of the mission.

**21. The Corridor**

This mission should not give you any major problems. Remember to keep your units in advantageous positions by finding good, defensible locations, preferable not too close to the walls. Use your indirect fire to force the enemy towards you. After your defensive play reaps its benefits you can switch to the offensive and clear out the remaining forces.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Dillinger">Dillinger</span>

Fortune's Glave and Petrov's Shard managed to find out that Enyo:Nomad has a secret base of operations somewhere in Denshen responsible for the black ops taken against their forces. You must conduct an assault on Dillinger's (a brilliant and well-positioned engineer inside Enyo:Nomad) fortified home in order to force him to reveal to you the location of Base 77.

**Hints (contains spoilers)**

**22. Break the Compound**

**23. Security Takedown**

**24. The Negotiation**

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Base_77">Base 77</span>

Destroying and data mining Enyo:Nomad's secret base of operations will weaken their presence in Denshen and arm you with top secret, important knowledge about the research being conducted there.

**Hints (contains spoilers)**

**25. Gain Access**

**26. Data Harvest**

**27. Set up the Bomb**

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Devastator">Devastator</span>

**Hints (contains spoilers)**

**28. First Encounter**

**29. Steal the Plans**

Don't hold back with the Devastator.  Unless you have a discrete plan in mind, you should be firing 2 to 5 shots each round.

**30. Facility Takedown**

It is even more important here that you abuse the Devastator.  Utilize your other units to protect the Devastator while it focuses on killing the entire map.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Open_Warfare">Open Warfare</span>

**Hints (contains spoilers)**

**43. Clemens Square**

**44. Rapid Takedown**

**45. Protection**

This map has 1 turn that lasts 50 seconds. There is NO WAY you will be able to finish this with first try.
Stay near the defense area. The enemy will come at you from three directions, and never in groups of more than two.  Assigning your three units to guard those entrances, however, is tricky because a rocket launcher will destroy the west wall of the defense area itself.  [Here](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/540645368622058133/9E6153163F796C4E76894CF3D7E3778A243D5BD6/) is a screenshot of a failsafe solution if you don't feel like doing some trial and error on this map. Alternatively, you can try placing your units in a compact triangle in the middle of the defense area, with shotgun facing east, and both rifles facing west.

Alternatively, you can get your shotgun to guard and kill 4-5 hostile right before they enter the red square that blows up the wall next to the green area, put sniper with his back towards the way your shotgun went such that he would see both: the bottom and the adjacent corridor. Finally fiddle around with MG a little. Would be useful to remember how long does it take to move around from point to point with your units to set up the timers for position change such that they all would be able to get back to the green spot few seconds before the end of the map just to wipe out anyone who successively could get in.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Endgame">Endgame</span>

**Hints (contains spoilers)**

**52. The Corridor**

This mission can be very tough without a seed that gives your sniper a good view, and to top it off, the middle part of the map that matters is nonrandom and particularly hazardous to cross.  You can expect enemy units to bunker in and wait you out, which is perilous because your main unit needs 3 turns to reach the objective.  Above all, make extra sure that your main unit doesn't stand up until you're positive the nests will be blown, and remember to take into account that a unit may take longer to reach the explosion zone than planned if it encounters an enemy unit.  Continue on Sight comes to mind.

**53. Ouroboros**

Focus on destroying most of the cover in the center.  Don't be too afraid of the enemy units not specifically inside the defense area: they act more like allies to the enemy AI rather than purposefully controlled units.  You only need to touch the objective area, so consider sending in a shotgunner for a suicide run.  Again, Continue on Sight proves to be an unfair advantage against the AI.
_Try to remember the moves you make. At least first few._

**54. The Reversal**

Now you have to defend the stronghold against your own moves&#160;:). 
If you were following the hint before - you should be fine in 4-6 turns.
