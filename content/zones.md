title: Zones

Zones can be used to specify certain areas of the map that you want to either focus on or ignore. They can be defined for any section of the map and will treat all units inside them equally. They have no effect unless you also use accompanying orders for focus zone or ignore zone. They are always square or rectangular. <div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:102px;"><img src="images/5/5c/Zone.jpg" />  <div class="thumbcaption">A Zone</div></div></div>


## <span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_a_Zone"> Creating a Zone </span>

To create a zone move the cursor to one corner of the zone you want to create, hold down the 'T' key on the keyboard and drag the cursor to the opposite corner. When you release 'T' the zone will be created. There is currently no interface for this so you will not see a preview while sizing the zone. Multiple zones can overlap each other freely.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Using_a_Zone"> Using a Zone </span>

Select a unit, right click on a zone and select either the focus zone or ignore zone order. This will cause your unit to focus/ignore the zone until you issue a later Clear all focus/ignore order.

Focusing on a zone will cause your unit to ignore any enemy units outside of that zone. Ignoring a zone will cause your unit to ignore any enemy units inside that zone. You can issue multiple ignore/focus orders that will be active at once to focus on/ignore multiple sections of the map.

A unit will not receive any kind of combat bonus for attacking enemy units inside a focused zone. It is solely used to determine which enemy units you will engage.

Zones currently cannot be deleted, and can be seen by your opponent during the following [[turns.md|turns]]. Neither are intended and will likely be fixed soon.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Examples_of_Usage">Examples of Usage</span>

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Counter_an_expected_distraction_from_multiple_positions">Counter an expected [[distraction.md|distraction]] from multiple positions</span>

You can either ignore the zone that you expect the distraction to come from or focus on the unit you want to kill. This is more effective than ignoring specific units if you don't know which unit will be the distraction but you know where the distraction will come from.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Ignore_a_position_of_superior_cover">Ignore a position of superior cover</span>

When moving (either to a new position or to adjust your fire angle from cover) you can create a zone behind a piece of cover that will provide a winning advantage (see [[principles-of-combat.md|Principles of Combat]]) to the enemy and ignore it. This means your unit will still engage other units where it has a better chance but won't stop to fight a losing battle.
