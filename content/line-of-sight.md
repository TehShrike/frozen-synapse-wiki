Line of sight (LoS) is everything that a given unit can see. LoS has unlimited range, but is limited to a field of view (FoV) that is usually around 120 degrees wide, depending on the unit (with snipers having the largest FoV and civilians having the smallest).

LoS is also interrupted completely by full-height objects, and partially by half-height objects.

The maximum range at which a [[principles-of-combat.md|direct fire]] unit will engage an enemy, is called the engagement range. Engagement range is currently strongly correlated with rate of fire, meaning that you usually shouldn't engage a unit with a smaller engagement range than your own within their engagement range unless you have a big situational advantage, primarily cover. See [[principles-of-combat.md|Principles of Combat]] for more details on what gives you a situational advantage.

Direct fire units can only engage if they're both within engagement range and line of sight.

Full-height and half-height objects affect the line of sight available to a unit. A unit can see past half-height objects when standing, but can not see through full-height objects. When a unit is ducked, it will also not be able to see past half-height objects. The angle at which a unit is aiming at an object determines how much of it's view is blocked. If the whole engagement range is blocked by an object, then a unit will not be able to see beyond it.

Be careful when positioning units at windows. Make sure to have your unit positions as close to the window as possible for maximum line of sight. Move the unit closer to either edge if you want it to see more of a particular side. In the animated image example, as the unit moves closer, the line of sight (yellow) becomes wider reaching closer to the maximum engagement range (orange). Hostile (1) can be seen, but hostile (2) can only be seen when the unit gets closer. With hostile (3), even though the engagement range intersects the middle of it, the line of sight doesn't and therefore still cannot be seen.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Testing_Line_Of_Sight"> Testing Line Of Sight </span>

A ruler to test a units line of sight may be generated by selecting the unit (or waypoint) and holding the V key. The dotted line indicates clear LoS while the 'fuzzy' line shows LoS that is affected by cover (ie. won't see ducked units, and will be penalised for firing into these areas as per cover rules)
