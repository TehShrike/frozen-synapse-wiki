title: Blue Sunlight

_From the dossiers on Blue Sunlight._
We live in an age of enhanced rationality.  Information and decision making all happen at a lightning pace: the shape provides us with extremely rapid processing engines which enshrine the high-velocity transaction of concepts.

But what is there outside this tight sphere of comprehension?

Twenty-five years ago, the Omega Point revealed itself to our Founder Denizen Creed in a burst of blue sunlight.  The Point told him that the universe would eventually contract into itself, and that all matter would be contained within a timeless point of infinite mass.

Indeed, all matter is currently contained within this Point as the revelation of the Omega Point encompasses all.

This might seem hard to understand, even paradoxical, but it is through paradox that we transcend the limits of the human brain.

You might believe that we are perfectly equipped to decode the mysteries of the universe.  However, our brains have evolved simply to give our ancestors control of their physical environment.  They were not "intended" to probe the convoluted depths of quantum mechanics.

So, how do we break free from this prison?  The only answer is to embrace the irrational revelation of the Omega Point!  As soon as we come to accept that we cannot know truth, then we must be ready for the enmeshing of the intuitive and the analytical.

What is the most perfect expression of this enmeshing that we already know?  Love.

Love is the force that draws partners, families and friends together.  We often describe love in terms of attraction, and indeed, it is exactly this attraction which is pulling the universe towards the Omega Point.  We are all fragments drawn together by love: this is exactly why, at times, we can feel so alone and alienated.  Our place is within the fabric of the universe.

The Omega Point teaches us that "after" the universe contracts, it will reach a point of maximal complexity.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Shape_Projector"> Shape Projector </span>

The Blue Sunlight shape projector appears to be an early iteration of the Brightling shape portal, providing high-bandwidth shape access at levels far exceeding the recommended maximum.

This has been deployed via the Blue Sunlight shape node network in Torpor and also, we believe, areas of Brightling.

New Blue Sunlight recruits are exposed to a profound shape connection, producing "transcendental" experiences.  The emotions associated with this are then used by Blue Sunlight members to entice the recruits into making commitments to the organisation.

The shape projector seems mostly functional: it does not correctly identify itself to the local shape networks, leading to some authorisation issues.

We believe that the organisation may well have other projectors located throughout the city.
