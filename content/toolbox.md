The UI Toolbox provides some advanced functions to create planning [[layers.md|layers]] and for hiding certain planning elements. It can be opened using the spanner icon at the bottom right of the ingame [[ui.md|interface]].



## <span class="mw-headline" id="Show...">Show...</span>

Check or uncheck each box to show or hide orders of that type. 'Currently selected only' will hide all orders that aren't for the currently selected unit. Hidden orders will still be executed and will still be submitted. This is mainly useful when you aren't using certain types of order and they are blocking other orders you want to use in confined spaces.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Plan_Layers">Plan Layers</span>

### <span class="mw-headline" id="New">New</span>

Creates a new layer at the currently selected waypoint. All orders after this waypoint will exist within a separate layer to the orders before the waypoint.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Next">Next</span>

Moves to the next layer of the current plan. If no layers have been created this will do nothing.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Previous">Previous</span>

Moves to the previous layer of the current plan. If no layers have been created this will do nothing.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="All">All</span>

Removes all layers and shows all orders as active again. This will not remove the orders themselves, just the layers.
