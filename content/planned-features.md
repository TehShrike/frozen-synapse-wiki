## <span class="mw-headline" id="2v2_and_FFA"> 2v2 and FFA </span>

16:28 (UTC) on 31.05, [[omroth.md|Omroth]] confirmed the that both 2v2 and FFA will come in the future:

"Omroth: yes 2v2 and FFA are planned but not particularly soon"

15:21 (UTC) on 12.06, Omroth specified that this will likely come late this year:

Little beyond this is known about the [[game-modes.md|game modes]].

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Elo_Ranking"> Elo Ranking </span>

Elo [[rank.md|ranking]] is a concept that originates from chess. The gist of it is that [[scoring.md|scores]] are based on the ranking of the person you're playing against. Winning against a good player will net more points than against a bad player, and losing against one will lose you less points than losing against a bad player.

Elo ranking was shown in this post[[1]](http://www.mode7games.com/blog/2011/05/18/elo-rankings-for-the-top-players/).

The organiser can make/generate the maps first, add them to the list, choose the tournament style - ie both ways, everyone plays the same map/group stages/playoff format etc."
