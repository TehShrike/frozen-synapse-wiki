title: Dark Mode

All game modes are available as [[light-mode.md|Light]] or Dark.  The difference is whether [[line-of-sight.md|line of sight]] is required to see enemy units.

In dark game modes, enemy positions are only shown when one or more of your units has line of sight.  This is commonly known as "fog of war" in many games.

*   Corpses are always shown.

*   [[principles-of-combat.md|Indirect fire]] units projectiles are always shown.

*   In [[extermination.md|Extermination]] initial enemy positions are shown by default.

*   In [[disputed.md|Disputed]] initial enemy positions are shown by default, and boxes collected by your enemy after turn 4 disappear from the map whether or not you have a direct visual on them.

*   In [[hostage.md|Hostage]] initial hostage positions are shown.

*   In [[hostage.md|Hostage]], [[charge.md|Charge]], and [[secure.md|Secure]], initial enemy positions are _not_ shown by default (though you can see what types of units your opponent is starting with).

Dark modes force players to consider a wider degree of what their opponent might do and expend more effort scouting and sneaking.  Your opponent doesn't know where your units are unless line of sight is acquired.  Since still units have an advantage over moving units, ambushes in places your opponent doesn't expect is a very effective strategy.

It is often useful in dark modes to use ignore [[zones.md|zones]] rather than ignore specific units since the particular unit which may need to be ignored is unknown, but their expected position may be guessed.
