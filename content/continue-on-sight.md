## <span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_Principle"> Basic Principle </span>

This is a command that causes a unit to have no reaction to any enemy coming into [[line-of-sight.md|Line of Sight]]. It will not engage any enemies, working the same as the [[ignore-focus.md|Ignore]] Enemy command.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Cancelling_the_Command"> Cancelling the Command </span>

This function is cancelled by the following commands:

*   Engage on Sight (its only purpose is to cancel Continue on Sight)

*   [[aim.md|Aim]]

*   [[ignore-focus.md|Focus on Enemy]]

However, it is **not** overridden by using the [[check.md|Check]] command.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Line_of_Sight"> Line of Sight </span>

While using this command, the unit's [[line-of-sight.md|Line of Sight]] follows its path. If there is no movement, the area it "looks" at stays the same.  Because the check command doesn't break continue on sight, it can be used to look in that direction for a second while moving, and then revert back to the path the unit is taking. If used on a way point, the direction the unit faces **will** stay.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_Uses"> Basic Uses </span>

*   This can be used when you want your unit to run across an area, and not engage any enemies and keep moving to a way point, this is useful for machine gunners on the first turn of an open map, as they generally have an enemy in line of sight to begin with.

*   It can also be used to stop your unit from firing on an enemy **during** combat so your unit can duck or move, potentially saving its life.

*   You can use a unit as a [[distraction.md|distraction]] with this command. A unit can dodge in and out of [[line-of-sight.md|Line of Sight]], drawing an enemy's attention. This would allow another one of your units to get into a better position, or engage the enemy first, producing a better outcome.
