title: Light Mode

All game modes are available as Light or [[dark-mode.md|Dark]].  The difference is whether [[line-of-sight.md|line of sight]] is required to see enemy units.  In light game modes, enemy positions are always shown. As a result, there is no need to use the check command for the purpose of scouting. All games appear light in replays.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Tactical_Differences"> Tactical Differences </span>

This minor change in rules creates a very different style of play.

*   Ambushes are more difficult to setup.

*   [[principles-of-combat.md|Indirect fire]] weapons are more dangerous.

*   Play tends to revolve more around countering what your opponent could do each turn rather than overall strategic goals and stealth.
