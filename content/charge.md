Charge mode is a [[game-modes.md|game mode]] where both players bid how far they can make it across the map after which the bid winner has to put his money where his mouth is so to speak. Games last a maximum of 6 [[turns.md|turns]].



## <span class="mw-headline" id="Bidding"> Bidding </span>

The game starts with both players [[bidding.md|bidding]] on the map. The map, along with the units each player has, is made visible to both players. Both players have to specify a vertical line somewhere along the map. This is their "bid line". The player who bids further from their starting side of the map wins the bidding.  The vertical line of the player who lost the bid is shown in purple.

Charge maps are wide, but less than full height. With an asymmetrical map, it is a good idea to take into account not only how far a position you think you could get to, but also how far your opponent could get.

If your opponent has one or more [[unit-types.md|shotgun]] units (which can move quite quickly) and there is an area in the middle of the map that would be easy to hold, you may be motivated to bid a bit farther, in order to avoid having to play defense.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Ending_conditions"> Ending conditions </span>

The game ends after six turns.

The bid winner wins if he has a unit on or past the line for the last 3 seconds of turn 6.

Before turn 6, if the attacking team exterminates the opposing side, they win the game.  As of turn 6, reaching the bid line is the only way for the attacker to win. During this last turn, exterminating the opposing side will not automatically bring victory  <sup>See game 138988</sup>

If the defending team exterminates all enemies, it is declared victorious right away.

## <span class="mw-headline" id="Scoring"> Scoring </span>

The [[scoring.md|score]] assigned to the winner is the percentage across the map the bid line is positioned multiplied by 200. So if the bid line is half way (50%) then the score is 100. The score assigned to the loser is (as always) the negative score of the winner.

### <span class="mw-headline" id="Example"> Example </span>

This is how scoring worked in game 10591:

<pre><span style="color:green;">Green</span> bids further from his side of the map than <span style="color:red;">Red</span> and therefore wins the bidding.
<span style="color:green;">Green</span> loses units, but achieves the objective.
As the bid line was approximately half way across the map (it's difficult to tell) the <span style="color:green;">Green</span> player wins roughly 100 points (actually winning 94 points).
